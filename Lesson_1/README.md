## Official documentation

For more information, visit the [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn)

## Get started

To launch React on your localhost, you need to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)

To test if Node.js is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```
The best browser for working with React code is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome), along with the [React developers tools](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/react-developer-tools)


## First React app

To create your first React app:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

Then, to start your app, run these commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd my-app
npm start
```

Finally, open your browser and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your app running.
